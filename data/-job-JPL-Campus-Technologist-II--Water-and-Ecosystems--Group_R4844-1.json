    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>The compounding impacts from climate change and rising temperatures have resulted in an increase in frequency and intensity of several hazards such as heatwaves and wildfires. For human settlements, especially in urbanized areas, persistent extreme heat is a dangerous and silent killer that claims more lives than the other hazards combined. The impact of extreme heat extends to natural ecosystems such as croplands, forests, wetlands and river systems and poses a significant climate adaptation challenge. Heatwaves over dry and drought-stricken landscapes such as California are particularly dangerous as they spark and facilitate the spreading of largescale wildfires.</p><p></p><p>We seek a technologist to join the Water and Ecosystems group (329F) who will support a variety of thermal remote sensing research and applications activities that investigate the impacts of elevated temperature phenomenon such as wildfire and heatwaves on human settlements as well as terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. They will use a wide variety of observation sources such as ground based/airborne thermal sensors and satellite instruments such as ECOSTRESS, VIIRS, and MODIS. They will also support efforts to link Earth science research, results, and datasets to applications benefits – advancing partnerships in the areas of extreme heat resilience, wildfire management, and environmental justice in climate change adaptation.</p><p></p><p>Responsibilities will include:</p><ul><li><p>Leverage a variety of remote sensing and in situ datasets to support calibration /validation of airborne flight campaign data for the HyTES mission.</p></li><li><p>Support remote sensing-based analysis (using ECOSTRESS, VIIRS, and GOES-R) of diurnal thermal cycle in urban and non-urban regions.</p></li><li><p>Support investigation into heatwave impacts on aquatic ecosystems in California.</p></li><li><p>Support partner engagement on topics of wildfires, drought, and extreme heat resilience, and environmental justice.</p></li><li><p>Support data science and data analysis needs for 329F research and application areas, and other JPL earth science missions include EMIT, ECOSTRESS, and SBG.</p></li><li><p>Support collection and analysis of multispectral thermal datasets from in situ, airborne, and satellite sources</p></li><li><p>Participate in proposal writing opportunities with 329F team members.</p></li><li><p>Participate in regular 329F team meetings</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b><u>The following qualifications are required:</u></b></p><ul><li><p>PhD degree in Earth science, Ecological science and engineering, Environmental engineering or similar. Two or more years of related experience is strongly preferred.</p></li><li><p>Direct experience with heatwave research, urban heat island applications, thermal remote sensing, and land cover land use mapping.</p></li><li><p>Demonstrated problem-solving ability in research and broad range of experimental skills including numerical modeling, remote sensing, and algorithm development.</p></li><li><p>Demonstrated ability to process multidimensional data from a range of observation sources such as field campaigns, airborne data, reanalysis, or satellite remote sensing.</p></li><li><p>Demonstrated ability to contribute to winning proposals and grants (i.e., NASA).</p></li><li><p>A track record of recent contributions to peer-reviewed publications.</p></li><li><p>Demonstrated interest in applications, science outreach, and partnership development.</p></li><li><p>Experience with scientific programming languages (such as Python, R, MATLAB), and high-performance computing.</p></li><li><p>Experience of working with large multidimensional geospatial datasets and spatiotemporal data visualization.</p></li><li><p>Excellent oral and written communication skills</p></li><li><p>Experience or interest in Earth science applications</p></li><li><p>Experience and /or interest in contributing to broader fields of weather and climate research, investigating land-atmosphere interaction, and water resources applications.</p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique.
