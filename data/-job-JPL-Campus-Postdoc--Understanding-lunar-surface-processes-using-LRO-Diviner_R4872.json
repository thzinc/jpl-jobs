    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>The Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment is one of seven instruments aboard NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched on June 18, 2009. It is the first instrument to create detailed day and night surface temperature maps of the Moon. Data from Diviner has helped identify potential ice deposits in the polar regions, map compositional variations on the surface and derive subsurface temperatures. Since July of 2009, Diviner has operated continuously, acquiring nearly one trillion radiometric measurements to create the most detailed and complete set of thermal measurements of any planet in the solar system.</p><p></p><p>The postdoctoral research associate will work with the advisor to investigate the surface of the Moon. Specifically, they will use data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (Diviner) to constrain the thermophysical properties of the surface. Areas of particular interest include volcanism, and the breakdown of rocks and the evolution of regolith. Additionally, the postdoctoral researcher will supervise undergraduate interns. The interns will use LRO Camera (LROC) images to count boulders surrounding cold-spot craters to assess spatial variability in the subsurface rock content.</p><p></p><p><b>Qualifications:</b></p><p>Applicants with a PhD in planetary science, physics, geology, astronomy, or a related field are encouraged to apply. Candidates should have a strong background in physics. Experience with some or all of the following is helpful but not required:</p><ul><li>Supervising students</li><li>Using remote sensing data</li><li>Using ArcGIS</li><li>Numerical modeling</li></ul><p>The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publications in the open literature.</p><p>Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoctoral Scholar positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique.
