That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>This opportunity is focused on the development of robust and data driven analysis and information systems to understand impacts of climate change on natural and working lands and aquatic systems in California, plan mitigation, and increase climate resilience, in line with the state of California’s climate change goals and initiatives. It is envisioned that this effort will be linked to an open source, cloud-based data system through which products will be delivered.</p><p></p><p>This opportunity is for up to four postdocs with a passion for connecting NASA data to science and applications communities in order maximize societal benefit and link communities needs back to future NASA missions, and to make data more accessible and meaningful in tackling applications, decision making, resource management and scientific research. This opportunity also involves advancing linkages between research and decision support, focused on water and natural resources management in California, including impacts of watershed disturbances on water quality for inland and coastal systems, drought, and climate change. Experience in or an interest in working with multiple remote sensing datasets is preferred.</p><p></p><p><b>Requirements: </b></p><p>The candidates must have completed a PhD or be scheduled to complete their PhD before the end of May 2023 in one of the following areas: remote sensing, computer science, environmental science and engineering, earth science. Candidates with backgrounds in one or more of these areas, terrestrial hydrology, the water cycle, the carbon cycle, wildfires or forest applications, are preferred. Successful candidates must also have strong programming skills in a scientific language (e.g. python, MATLAB, R) and experience in statistical analysis.  Applicants should have demonstrated quantitative and computational skills, a successful publication record, and the ability to work in an interdisciplinary research environment.</p><p></p><p>The start date for this position will be May 2023.</p><p></p><p>The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publications in the open literature.</p><p></p><p>Applicants may be subject to <a href=\"https://postdocs.jpl.nasa.gov/prospective-postdocs/eligibility/\" target=\"_blank\">additional program requirements</a> by NASA. Postdoc positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years.
