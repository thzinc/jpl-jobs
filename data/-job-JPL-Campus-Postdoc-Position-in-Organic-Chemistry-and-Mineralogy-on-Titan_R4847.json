    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>The Laboratory Studies groups seeks a postdoc to perform laboratory research on the organic chemistry and mineralogy of Titan&#39;s surface. This work will involve the study of binary organic mixtures at cryogenic temperatures under Titan-like surface conditions, through the use of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy. We seek a molecular-level understanding of the interactions between the components of these mixtures, with an emphasis on crystalline structure and its relationship to bulk properties such as solubility, thermal stability, and mechanical strength. Opportunities for extending this work to high pressure and the use of synchrotron sources may also be available. An additional project will involve the study of the crystalline morphology of pure Titan surface materials with application to the upcoming Dragonfly mission. </p><p></p><p>Candidate Qualifications:</p><ul><li>Candidates must have a Ph.D. in planetary science, physics, chemistry or equivalent. Experience in the laboratory simulation of icy worlds surfaces, preferably Titan, is required.</li><li>Experience in the acquisition and analysis of infrared and/or Raman spectroscopy is required. </li><li>Candidates who have strong experience in chemistry and physics with hand on laboratory work are preferred.</li><li>Good writing and communication skills are prerequisites and it is preferred that the candidate is able to publish his/her work in peer-reviewed periodicals or conferences.</li></ul><p>The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publications in the open literature.</p><p>Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoctoral Scholar positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests. </p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique.
