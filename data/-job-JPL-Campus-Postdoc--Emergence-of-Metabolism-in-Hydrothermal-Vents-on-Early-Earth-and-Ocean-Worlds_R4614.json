    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and on Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and in communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to both contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The Postdoctoral scholars at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>The Laboratory Studies group within the Planetary Science Section at JPL is seeking a postdoc to work on hydrothermal geochemistry and planetary habitability research efforts in the Origins and Habitability Laboratory at JPL. The candidate will work with an Astrobiology scientist and collaborate with the JPL Electrochemical Technologies group on laboratory simulations of hydrothermal vents on the early Earth, testing electrochemical and organic reactions toward the emergence of metabolism.</p><p></p><p>Responsibilities:</p><ul><li><p>The appointee will conduct laboratory experiments simulating organic reactions with hydrothermal chimneys and minerals under early Earth conditions. The laboratory experiments will focus on reacting carbon compounds with synthetic minerals in a high pressure, flow-through hydrothermal reactor. The postdoc will carry out an experimental plan according to a newly funded project to test the emergence of carbon fixation in a hydrothermal system, analyzed using NMR, GC, IC, and related techniques. The candidate will lead completion of specific tasks for the funded project and will also have some opportunity to develop their own experimental plans. If interested in this position, candidates should submit their application and will be contacted to discuss more about the project.</p></li><li><p>The position will require mentoring of an undergraduate or graduate student, as well as participating in education / public outreach efforts related to the work.</p></li><li><p>The candidate will assist with general lab management tasks, including helping to develop lab safety protocols and procedures, training new personnel as appropriate, and maintenance of equipment / instruments.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>Required qualifications:</p><ul><li><p>Candidates should have a recent Ph.D. in chemistry, geoscience, or related fields. The ideal candidate will be enthusiastic about astrobiology and participating in mission-relevant research, and in being a collaborative member of a lab group that studies how life emerges and thrives in planetary environments. As this project will utilize a high-pressure reactor, prior experimental / laboratory experience is required. </p></li></ul><p></p><p>Desired qualifications:</p><ul><li><p>Experience with or willingness to learn how to operate pressurized reactor systems. It is not required that candidates have worked with reactors before, but experience with any lab work that requires strict adherence to protocol and safety guidelines is desired.  For analysis the project will involve liquid 1H NMR, ion chromatography, gas chromatography; experience with or willingness to learn these techniques is desired.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publications in the open literature.</p><p></p><p>Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoctoral Scholar positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique.
