That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>The Tracking Systems and Application Section provides world-leading capability and expertise in a wide range of technologies that are critical to spacecraft tracking and related applications. The Section undertakes precise ranging measurements for gravity sensing applications, using both laser and microwave ranging.  In addition, the section uses precision orbit determination (POD) of low Earth orbiter (LEO) missions using GNSS and other data, calibration and validation of NASA’s satellite altimeter missions as well as supporting NASA&#39;s deep-space missions by providing to the JPL navigators unique and extremely precise radiometric sources and data types. The Section provides the Deep Space Network (DSN) with precision atomic frequency and time references and distribution systems. The Section also delivers to JPL navigators a host of other products that are required for deep space navigation such as celestial and terrestrial reference frame coordinates, Earth orientation parameters, and calibrations to account for the effects of the Earth&#39;s troposphere and ionosphere on radiofrequency metric tracking data-types.</p><p></p><p>For terrestrial and near-Earth users the Section offers the highest accuracy Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based positioning and timing products and services. The Section also performs extensive scientific investigations using its technologies in the areas of planetary dynamics, astrophysics, astrometry and radio astronomy, gravitational waves, geophysics, and fundamental physics.</p><p></p><p><b><u>Responsibilities:</u></b></p><p>As a <b>Computer Systems Engineer</b> with the Tracking Systems and Applications Section you will be reporting to the Manager of Section and working within JPL’s Communications, Tracking and Radar Division .</p><p></p><p>This position will be responsible for managing over 180 computers and storage servers of various operating systems in JPL and Goldstone facilities and will manage a section-dedicated data center infrastructure.</p><p>This position will also be required to:</p><ul><li><p>Work with group supervisors for computing requirements best suited for the Section and project goals.</p></li><li><p>Work with group supervisors in the Section for accounting and services provided through the JPL Charge-Back mechanism.</p></li><li><p>Work and coordinate with various JPL entities such as the Information and Technology Solutions Directorate and infrastructure groups to address Section computing requirements.</p></li><li><p>Work with various projects, inside and outside of the Section, to evaluate and recommend technologies to meet project requirements.</p></li><li><p>Manage hardware and software maintenance contracts for all computing resources in the Section.</p></li><li><p>Work with subcontracting firms to provide additional system administration support to the Section.</p></li><li><p>Work with the real-time Global Differential GPS (GDGPS) project and manage over 100 computers and network equipment as well as networking topology and security requirements.</p></li><li><p>Work closely with the GDGPS project and external customers (both commercial and government) for product delivery which includes security compliance, access control, troubleshooting, and service provisioning.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Manage data center colocation contracts on behalf of GDGPS project.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b><u>Qualifications:</u></b></p><p>Typically requires a Bachelor&#39;s degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering or related subject area with a minimum of 3 years of related experience; or Master&#39;s degree in similar subject area with a minimum of 1 years of related experience; or PhD in similar subject area.</p><p></p><p>Working knowledge of the following software and hardware technologies:</p><ul><li><p>Operating systems: Linux</p></li><li><p>Software/tools: Python, Shell (bash, tcsh, etc).</p></li><li><p>Hardware:  Dell PowerEdge Servers or similar.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>Demonstrated ability to work in a team environment with good communication and organization skills.</p><p></p><p><b><u>Desired Qualifications:</u></b></p><p>Working knowledge of a majority of the following software and hardware technologies:</p><ul><li><p>Operating systems: The following forms of Linux: Redhat Enterprise 7-8, Ubuntu, Scientific Linux, VxWorks, Beowulf Cluster Environment, Cisco IOS, Network Appliance Data Ontap</p></li><li><p>Software/tools: Matlab, MySQL, Apache, PHP, XML, Perl, Java, Gnu C Compiler, HTML, VMWare, Qemu KVM, Linux kickstart, Veritas Enterprise Netbackup.</p></li><li><p>Hardware:  Dell PowerEdge Servers, Precision workstations, Brocade Fiber Channel Switch, Raitan KVM switches, Servertech switched CDU, APC switched PDU, APC UPS, Netgear network switches (both unmanaged and managed), HP management switches, Cisco PIX firewall appliance, Cisco ASA security appliance.</p></li></ul><div></div><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique.
