Developing new and enabling atomic quantum sensors and clocks, and applying them to precision measurements and fundamental physics are the primary focus of our research efforts. Research activities range from basic concept study, science experiments, proof-of-principle demonstration, to instrument prototype development. Major areas of interest include a) Atomic frequency standards and clocks, b) Atom interferometry and quantum sensors, c) Laser and quantum communication and links, and d) Precision measurements and fundamental physics experiments in space. Currently we are looking for one or more highly motivated and capable postdoctoral researchers in the projects of i) Miniature Space Optical Clock based on singly trapped Yb&#43; ions (mSOC), ii) Micro Mercury Trapped Ion Clock (M2TIC), iii) various atom interferometer based sensors, iv) Dark energy detection experiments on Einstein Elevator, and v) Bose Einstein Condensate Cold Atom Laboratory (BECCAL).</p><p>The successful candidate(s) will have the opportunities to join and participate in one or more research projects, in all aspects of investigation and implementation, experiments and analyses, as well as exploration of science applications of the instruments. The appointee(s) are also encouraged to participate and contribute to other relevant activities in the group as opportunities and interests arise. The appointee(s) will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, Dr. Nan Yu, and work closely with other staff members and researchers, resulting in publications in the open literature. <br /><br />Qualifications<br /><br />Candidates should have a PhD in Physics, Electric Engineering, Optics, or related physical science discipline with a strong background in relevant fields of atomic, molecular, optical, and quantum physics. Prior experiences and demonstrated experimental research abilities in ultra-cold atoms, Bose Einstein condensate, laser cooling and ion trapping, and atom interferometer and clocks research and instrument development are of great value. Background in precision measurements and fundamental physics are also desired. U.S.-person candidates are preferred for the M2TIC project. Candidates with their PhD within the past five years since the date of their application are eligible. Postdoctoral Scholar positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years.</p><p></p><p>Applicants may be subject to <a href=\"http://postdocs.jpl.nasa.gov/prospective-postdocs/eligibility/\" target=\"_blank\">additional program requirements</a> by NASA.
