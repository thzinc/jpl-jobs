JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and on Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before.</p><p></p><p>JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and in communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to both contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges.</p><p></p><p>The Postdoctoral scholars at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p><b>Responsibilities:</b></p><p></p><p>The postdoc will conduct publishable research and development in autonomous dexterous manipulation and associated anomaly identification and recovery for robotic in-space manufacturing and assembly. The<span> </span><span><span>postdoc</span></span><span> </span>will do hands-on experiments with robotic systems to verify and validate robotic capabilities. The primary research topic is autonomous vision guided dexterous manipulation for forceful interactions of high degree of freedom robotic systems with semi-stiff objects in the presence of uncertainty. Technical approaches are expected to be associated with estimation of state of interaction compared to expected modeled states and planning, sensing, and control to complete assembly steps and recover from anomalous conditions.<br /> <br /><b>Qualifications</b>:<br />The candidate will have a Ph.D. in a robotics-related engineering field with a strong publication record.<br />The candidate should have expertise in controls, system identification, manipulator kinematics, autonomous behaviors, and C/C&#43;&#43; embedded software development.<br /> <br />Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoctoral Scholar positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique.
