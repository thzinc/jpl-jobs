That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>The Tracking Systems and Application Section provides world-leading capability and expertise in a wide range of technologies that are critical to spacecraft tracking and related applications. The Section undertakes precise ranging measurements for gravity sensing applications, using both laser and microwave ranging. In addition, the section uses precision orbit determination (POD) of low Earth orbiter (LEO) missions using GNSS and other data, calibration and validation of NASA’s satellite altimeter missions as well as supporting NASA&#39;s deep-space missions by providing to the JPL navigators unique and extremely precise radiometric sources and data types. The Section provides the Deep Space Network (DSN) with precision atomic frequency and time references and distribution systems. The Section also delivers to JPL navigators a host of other products that are required for deep space navigation such as celestial and terrestrial reference frame coordinates, Earth orientation parameters, and calibrations to account for the effects of the Earth&#39;s troposphere and ionosphere on radiofrequency metric tracking data-types.</p><p></p><p><u>Qualifications</u></p><p></p><ul><li>Students are typically enrolled at least half-time at an accredited local college or university pursuing a Bachelor&#39;s, Master’s, or PhD in Electrical Engineering or other technical discipline related to work assignment</li><li>Must be available to work a minimum of 8 hours per week, with a maximum of 30 hours per week during the academic school year</li><li>Minimum cumulative GPA 3.0 out of 4.0 or equivalent</li><li>Recently completed coursework providing an understanding and application of standard principles, theories, concepts and techniques in related work assignment</li><li>General knowledge of applicable industry and/or academic practices and standards in related work assignment</li><li>Relevant internship experience</li><li>Demonstrated leadership abilities</li><li>Good verbal and written communications skills with ability to work in a team environment</li></ul><p></p><p><b><u>Responsibilities:</u></b></p><p></p><p>We invite you to join the Tracking Systems and Application Section within the<b> GNSS and Signals of Opportunity Group</b> (335B) to serve as an <b>Academic Part Time Employee. </b>You will be reporting administratively to the Group Supervisor of the GNSS And Signals Of Opportunity Flight Instruments.</p><p></p><p>This group is responsible for delivering flight instruments, primarily based on the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, for use in space to measure atmospheric properties of Earth and planets.</p><p></p><p><b><u> Tasks Include</u></b></p><ul><li>Support Lab activities including setting up tests, lab equipment and programming embedded systems.</li><li>Work with a team to develop and test GNSSS receivers for small sats and cubesats. </li><li>Support Shipping and Loan Pool activities related to ground support equipment set up and transportation.</li><li>Use Oscilloscopes, Spectrum analyzers and GNSS simulators to facilitate testing.</li><li>Support the software team writing and testing of GNSS Instrument software.</li><li>Participate in lab maintenance, set up and cleaning activities.</li><li>Write software test scripts and perform and execute test sequences</li></ul><p><b><u>Preferred Skills:</u></b></p><ul><li>Familiarity with electronics engineering, Radio frequency communications and digital signal processing.  </li><li>Knowledge of lab equipment including signal generators, network analyzers and digital multimeters.</li><li>Experience with Python and C&#43;&#43;. </li><li>Strong background in software systems architecture, design, development, integration, test, deployment, and/or operations, i.e., the full project and software development life cycle.</li></ul><p></p><p>The typical hourly rate for this job in Pasadena, California depending on education level is $19 as a freshman, $22 as a sophomore, $26 as a junior, $29 as a senior</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique.
