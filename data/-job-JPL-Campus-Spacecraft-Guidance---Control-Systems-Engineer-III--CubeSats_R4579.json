Utah State University’s Space Dynamics Laboratory (SDL), in Logan, UT, is designing, fabricating, testing, and delivering six SunRISE CubeSats, with Blue Canyon Technologies’ (BCT) XACT-50 for the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) and Georgia Tech Research Corporation’s (GTRC) Cold Gas Propulsion System. The CubeSats will be operated by JPL using JPL’s institutional assets and processes. Launch is planned for no-earlier than September of 2024 and the nominal mission duration is 1 year, after the initial commissioning period of 6 weeks.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique.
