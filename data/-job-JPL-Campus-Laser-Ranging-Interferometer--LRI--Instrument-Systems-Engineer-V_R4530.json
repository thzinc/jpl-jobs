That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>The Tracking Systems and Applications Section (335) in the Communications, Tracking, and Radar Division (33) is currently searching for a senior Lead Instrument System Engineer for the Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) on the NASA Mass Change mission. This position reports to the Group Supervisor of 335F, the Gravity Sensing Instruments Group.</p><p></p><p>As the <b>Lead Instrument System Engineer</b>, you will participate in developing the Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) instrument, the primary payload on the NASA Mass Change mission.</p><p></p><p>The Mass Change Mission is a NASA Earth Science Decadal Observable Mission that measures the long-term movement of water on the earth to study climate change.  This mission will use the LRI to make precise measurements of the distance between two satellites to measure the changing gravity map of the earth.  Mass Change continues its very successful microwave-based predecessors, GRACE and GRACE Follow-on, the latter of which flew the LRI as a successful technology demonstration. Mass Change is a US/German partnership.</p><p></p><p><b>Responsibilities: </b></p><p>As the LRI Lead Instrument System Engineer, you will be responsible for the definition, architecture, development, and performance analysis of the LRI instrument. In this role, you will proactively define, coordinate, balance and integrate technical and programmatic issues in an end-to-end manner to ensure that the total system satisfies the customer&#39;s requirements, expectations, and constraints within the allocated resources and with acceptable risk. You will develop and maintain system architectures, requirements, and interfaces; manage technical resources (mass, power, data, volume etc.); analyze and model the LRI design; verify and validate the instrument system; evaluate and manage risk and control the system change process. You will partner with other engineers on the LRI team and Mass Change Project personnel to accomplish highly complex system engineering tasks of significant impact. You will lead the development, negotiation and documentation of engineering requirements and interface agreements. You will lead the analyses and trade studies of the LRI instrument and adapt complex technical models to create improved products for the organization.</p><p></p><p>You will also use and apply advanced understanding of laser metrology principles to support the test definition and development of validation methods and analysis techniques during integration and testing of LRI and be responsible for presentations at peer and Project reviews.
