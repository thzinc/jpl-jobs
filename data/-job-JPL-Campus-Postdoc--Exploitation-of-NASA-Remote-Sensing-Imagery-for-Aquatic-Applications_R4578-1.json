That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and on Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and in communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to both contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The Postdoctoral scholars at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>Aquatic ecosystems are a key science focus area for several NASA missions, including but not limited to, the Plankton, Aerosol, Clouds, ocean Ecosystem (PACE), Geostationary Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer (GLIMR), and Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) missions. We are looking for applicants that would develop/refine aquatic algorithms; leverage existing airborne and spaceborne data for aquatic science and applications; exploit multi-mission data for interdisciplinary science at aquatic interfaces.</p><p></p><p><b>Qualifications: </b></p><p>PhD in marine science, optical oceanography, or a related technical discipline</p><p>- Excellent oral (including public speaking) and written communication skills</p><p>- Experience in processing and analyzing remote sensing data</p><p>- Experience with collection of in situ data for validation of aquatic remote sensing derived products</p><p>- Track record of aquatic algorithm development, and potential utilization of state-of-the-art data science and machine learning methods for algorithm optimization </p><p>- Track record of contributing to peer-reviewed publications in the area of ocean biology and biogeochemistry / ocean optics</p><p></p><p>The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publications in the open literature.</p><p></p><p>Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoctoral Scholar positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years.
