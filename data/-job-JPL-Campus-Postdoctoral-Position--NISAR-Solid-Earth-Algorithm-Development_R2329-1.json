    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>The JPL Earth Science Section is looking for a Postdoc to develop and test methods in order to assess and mitigate hazards from earthquakes, landslides, and land subsidence with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in preparation for the forthcoming NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission. The Postdoc would also conduct research on relevant topics in solid Earth science to advance understanding the dynamics and structure of the Earth’s surface layers, crust, and mantle.</p><p></p><p>The NISAR mission is a dual-frequency L-/S-band SAR satellite scheduled for launch in late 2023 and recently identified as a pathfinder for the NASA Earth System Observatory. NISAR will acquire global dual-polarimetric L-band data with 20 MHz range bandwidth every 12 days (6 days ascending and descending), delivering unprecedented dense time-series of Geocoded Unwrapped interferograms (GUNW), Radar-coordinates Single Look Complex (RSLC), and new Geocoded Single Look Complex (GSLC) products to address key science questions and application needs relevant to solid Earth, ecosystems, cryosphere, and hydrology. NASA is developing AWS cloud-based platforms to enable scientists and engineers to collaborate on new algorithms that can extract the desired information from NISAR products using the latest big-data and open-source technologies.</p><p></p><p>SAR analysis methods will encompass the NISAR solid Earth science and application requirements, including secular (interseismic and other gradual processes), coseismic, and transient (short-term changes on volcanoes, landslides, and other geohazards) surface deformation. Algorithms will be designed to work with the products generated by the NISAR processor and will ingest representative multi-frequency and multi-polarization radar data along with a variety of heterogeneous data products for calibration and validation.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Postdoc will:</p><p>•             Develop, implement, and test new and existing surface displacement time-series analysis methods applicable to NISAR data in a cloud-based environment</p><p>•             Evaluate the benefits of AI and/or physics-based and statistical models for the analysis methods and make extensive use of interferometric time-series and SAR pixel offset tracking.</p><p>•             Interact with the NISAR Algorithm Development Team and the NISAR Project Science Team as well as the broader science and application community</p><p>•             Disseminate the outcome of the algorithm development via github, conferences, and peer-reviewed publications</p><p></p><p><b>Qualifications:</b></p><p>Applicants should have a Ph.D. in:</p><p>•             Physics or Geological Science</p><p>•             Earth system science or a related field.</p><p></p><p>We seek a creative and highly motivated person with strong remote sensing background and software development skills, familiar with SAR and interferometric SAR techniques, and excellent oral and written communication skills in English.</p><p></p><p>The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publications in literature.</p><p></p><p>Applicants may be subject to <a href=\"https://postdocs.jpl.nasa.gov/prospective-postdocs/eligibility/\" target=\"_blank\">additional program requirements</a> by NASA. Postdoc positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.</p><p></p><p>The candidate must be detail oriented, be able to work both independently and in close collaboration with others, should have substantial abilities in programming (python or similar) and be familiar with spatial analysis methods as well as solutions for processing big data. Prior experience of working with InSAR or pixel offset tracking techniques and time-series analysis for surface deformation mapping, and with existing spaceborne and airborne SAR data are regarded as merits.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique. This includes a variety of health, dental, vision, wellbeing, and retirement plans, paid time off, learning, rideshare, childcare, flexible schedule, parental leave and many more. Our focus is on work-life balance, and living healthy, fulfilling lives as we Dare Mighty Things Together.
