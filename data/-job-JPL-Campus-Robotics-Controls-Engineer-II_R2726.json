    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>As NASA’s lead center for robotic exploration, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory develops advanced robotics controls and autonomy technology to enable increasingly capable missions to planetary bodies. Technologies are also developed for non-NASA sponsors that can benefit future NASA missions. </p><p></p><p>The Robotics Controls area of the Mobility and Robotic Systems section (<a href=\"http://robotics.jpl.nasa.gov\" target=\"_blank\">robotics.jpl.nasa.gov</a>) has four groups that provide controls and autonomy for robotic systems across a wide range of domains including surface and aerial mobility, manipulation, and maritime and multi-agent autonomy. </p><ul></ul><p>The individual will perform research and development in controls and autonomy for robotic systems, including development and implementation of novel concepts, publishing, and writing proposals for new work.  </p><p></p><p>JPL robotics has contributed to numerous NASA missions including Mars Exploration Rover, Mars Phoenix, Mars Science Laboratory, Mars InSight, and Mars 2020 (including Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter).  Join us as we develop technologies for future  missions and robotics technologies in the national interest. The Mars Sample Return Lander will collect the core samples from the Mars 2020 mission and launch them into Mars orbit for subsequent return to Earth. Development is underway for lunar missions to demonstrate advanced manipulation and collaborative mobile robotics. A potential Europa Lander mission would acquire surface samples to learn about the habitability of the subsurface liquid ocean. An Enceladus Lander mission would collect and analyze ice surface material that was ejected by continuously erupting plumes from the subsurface ocean, potentially discovering evidence of extant life; or a snake robot could slither down the vents to then sample from the subsurface ocean. </p><p></p><p>JPL robotics also supports many research efforts for non-NASA sponsors that develop technologies which could benefit future NASA missions.  JPL’s RoboSimian robot participated in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/video/details.php?id&#61;1382\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/video/details.php?id&#61;1382</a>).  JPL participated in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge (<a href=\"https://costar.jpl.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">https://costar.jpl.nasa.gov/</a>). </p><p></p><p><b>Qualification:</b></p><p>Preferred candidates will have a Masters with 1&#43; year of relevant experience in developing robotic technologies, or Ph.D. from a leading robotics program with 0&#43; years of relevant experience. Practical experience with hardware and field experimentation is valuable. Candidates are sought across a range of skills including the following:</p><ul><li>Perception, planning, navigation, machine learning, and autonomy for surface, underwater, and aerial mobility systems</li><li>Intelligent manipulation</li><li>Manipulator and vehicle concepts and advanced control</li><li>Autonomous navigation and mobility</li><li>Sensor fusion for localization and mapping</li><li>Multi-robot architecture and behavior design</li><li>Learning and estimation of system and interaction models</li><li>Distributed estimation, world model building, knowledge sharing</li><li>Distributed task recognition, allocation, and scheduling</li><li>Embedded C/C&#43;&#43;/Python robotic software development for controls and autonomy</li></ul><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique. This includes a variety of health, dental, vision, wellbeing, and retirement plans, paid time off, learning, rideshare, childcare, flexible schedule, parental leave and many more.
