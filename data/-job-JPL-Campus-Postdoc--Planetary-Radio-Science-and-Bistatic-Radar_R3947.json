    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>We are seeking postdoctoral researcher candidates to join the Planetary Radar and Radio Sciences group at JPL, to carry out research focused on gravity science and bistatic radar to study planetary atmospheres, interiors and surfaces. The PRRS group possesses broad expertise in collecting, processing, analyzing, and interpreting radiometric measurements, and has access to a wealth of radio science data from numerous NASA and ESA missions.</p><p></p><p>The successful candidate will split their time as follows: i) collaborating with the JPL advisor, Marzia Parisi, on the analysis of Cassini Grand Finale Radio Science data with the objective of better understanding the small-scale structure of the deep zonal winds of Saturn through the recovery of its gravity field; ii) collaborating with JPL researchers Kamal Oudrhiri and Nereida Rodriguez-Alvarez in developing new tools for analyzing bistatic radar measurements of the surface of Pluto collected by New Horizons mission in coordination with the Principal Investigator of the Radio Science Experiment (REX), on-board the New Horizons Mission.</p><p></p><p><b>Responsibilities:</b></p><ul><li>Use of in-house software for radio science data processing.</li><li>Use of orbit determination codes for the retrieval of parameters of interest.</li><li>Interpretation of the research results in terms of atmospheric dynamics.</li><li>Study the implications for the evolution and energy transport of Saturn’s atmosphere and interior.</li><li>Development of tools for processing the bistatic radar data from New Horizons mission.</li><li>Development of algorithms to link the bistatic radar data to the geophysical properties of Pluto’s surface.</li><li>Document and publish data analysis results of gravity and bistatic radar investigations.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>Qualifications:</b></p><ul><li>Ph. D in Physics, Geophysics, Planetary Science or Aerospace Engineering.</li><li>Experience with orbit determination and radiometric data processing.</li><li>Experience with optimization algorithms.</li><li>Knowledge of planetary atmospheric dynamics of gas and ice giants.</li><li>Experience with bistatic radar data processing.</li><li>Experience with geometrical and geophysical interpretation of scattered signals.</li><li>Knowledge of planetary surface properties of Solar System bodies with large ice and rock structures.</li><li>Programming skills in Matlab and/or Python.</li></ul><p></p><p>The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publications in the open literature.</p><p></p><p>Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA.
