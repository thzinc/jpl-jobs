    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>The Jet Propulsion Laboratory Imaging Spectroscopy Group seeks a postdoctoral scholar to help develop the next generation of remote imaging spectrometer systems.  They will analyze imaging spectrometer radiance and reflectance data from airborne and orbital campaigns, advancing science data infrastructure and calibration to tackle a range of pressing Earth science problems. </p><p></p><p>JPL has a 40 year history of imaging spectroscopy excellence dating to the first airborne instruments.  Today, it designs and operates airborne, orbital, and planetary spectrometers.  These include the EMIT instrument onboard the International Space Station, the High Resolution Volatiles and Mineralogy Mapper for the Moon (HVM3), and the Mapping Imaging Spectrometer for Europa (MISE).  Its airborne imaging spectrometers, such as PRISM and the AVIRIS series, conduct regular field campaigns around the world. </p><p></p><p>The JPL team advances both the hardware and alignment of imaging spectrometer instruments, but also data analysis with state-of-the-art algorithms pushing the frontiers of calibration, atmospheric correction, and geophysical mapping.  These data provide critical information to the public on our changing planet, its ecosystems, water resources, and surface composition.</p><p></p><p><b>Required Qualifications:</b></p><p>The ideal candidate would have a strong computer science background with experience in statistics and machine learning.  Experience in interpreting remote sensing datasets, and imaging spectrometer data in particular, is desirable.  A good match will also have interest in Earth science problems and a willingness to learn the basic physics principles of remote measurement.  They will have familiarity with designing, implementing, and validating algorithms running on high-performance computing infrastructure.</p><p></p><p>The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publications in the open literature.</p><p></p><p>Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoctoral Scholar positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.</p><p><span> </span></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique.
