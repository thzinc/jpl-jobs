We are located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we encourage passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward perfection.</p><p></p><p><b>Responsibilities: </b></p><p>The robotics section at JPL, the place where robots for planetary exploration are born! We engage in research, technology development, and the creation of sophisticated robotic hardware platforms and systems from architectural concept through operations.</p><p></p><p>Members of this team investigate, plan, build and develop robotic hardware for a wide variety of applications and environments. Robots developed by this team are built to operate from the ice expanses of the Arctic to the crushing depths of Earth’s oceans; from the hellish conditions of Venus, to Mars, to the frozen moons of Enceladus and Europa. Teams apply research to the planning, design, development, and testing of mechanical and/or electromechanical systems for mobility, manipulation, and climbing; sensors; instruments; and controls.</p><p></p><p>The Mars Sample Return (MSR) campaign includes the Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL) which will take samples collected by the Perseverance Rover and launch them back to space on a rocket. The SRL accomplishes this with the Sample Transfer Handling System (STHS) payload utilizing the 7-DOF Sample Transfer Arm (STA) to retrieve tubes directly from the Perseverance Rover, or off of the ground where they are dropped by the Sample Retrieval Helicopter (SRH).</p><p></p><p>As an intern on the SRL Robotics System Engineering (RSE) team, you will help solve a variety of problems working with a multi-disciplinary team. These tasks may include using Matlab, C&#43;&#43;, and other tools to assist in performing analysis of the STA for the STHS as well as the Bradbury 7-DOF testbed arm, potentially including kinematic reachability, manipulability, accuracy, static loads, and others. You may also be asked to help develop tooling to automate the exercise of these analyses and generating report material. At the end of the internship the you will have helped the team to understand how the design of the STA meets the required needs of the STHS, as well as gaining invaluable experience from our engineers.</p><p></p><p><b>Qualifications: </b></p><p>What it takes:</p><ul><li>Must be available to work at least 40 hours/week, in person, for at least 10 weeks in Summer 2023 (longer duration is welcome up to 16 weeks).</li><li>Must be currently enrolled in a college or university pursuing a bachelors, masters, or PhD in Robotics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, or related technical field.
