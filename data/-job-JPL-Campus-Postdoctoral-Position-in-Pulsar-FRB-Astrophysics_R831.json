    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and on Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and in communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to both contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The Postdoc at JPL benefits from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), managed by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), invites applications for a postdoctoral research position at JPL to focus on studies of neutron stars, pulsars, and fast radio bursts. We are looking for enthusiastic and motivated candidates interested in both modeling and observational aspects of neutron stars and fast transients.</p><p></p><p>The JPL pulsar group is involved in a number of projects, including deep searches for pulsars at the galactic center region of the galaxy, multiwavelength studies of magnetars and fast radio bursts, and pulsar timing applications. The JPL team has recently commissioned state-of-the-art hardware in support of these projects, enabling observations with the Deep Space Network’s (DSN) large 70-m diameter dishes at all three DSN complexes.</p><p></p><p>Applicants should hold a PhD in physics or astronomy and have published in a  relevant field, including pulsar astronomy, fast radio burst science, time domain astronomy, or radio interferometry. The candidate is expected to have strong computational skills, and able to work well in a team. The postdoc will be based at JPL, however, strong collaboration with the Caltech campus will be expected. Postdoctoral positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years.</p><p></p><p>The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publications in the open literature.</p><p></p><p>Applicants may be subject to <a href=\"https://postdocs.jpl.nasa.gov/prospective-postdocs/eligibility/\" target=\"_blank\">additional program requirements</a> by NASA. Postdoc positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique. This includes a variety of health, dental, vision, wellbeing, and retirement plans, paid time off, learning, rideshare, childcare, flexible schedule, parental leave and many more. Our focus is on work-life balance, and living healthy, fulfilling lives as we Dare Mighty Things Together. For benefits eligible positions, benefits are effective the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following the employee’s start date.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">For further benefits information click <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.jpl.jobs/benefits-perks\">Benefits and Perks</a></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><span>The hiring range displayed below is specifically for those who will work in or reside in the location listed. In extending an offer, Jet Propulsion Laboratory considers factors including, but not limited to, the candidate’s job related skills, experience, knowledge, and relevant education/training.
