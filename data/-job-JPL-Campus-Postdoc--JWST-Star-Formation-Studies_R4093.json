    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and on Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and in communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to both contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The Postdoctoral scholars at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p><b>Responsibilities:</b></p><p>The postdoctoral researcher will work on the JWST/MIRI GTO program led by Dr. Margaret Meixner.  The program will pursue two science themes: star formation at low metallicity, and dust evolution in galaxies. Four targets were selected to sample a range of metallicities and study their star formation by identifying the young stellar objects: Large Magellanic Cloud super star cluster candidate region N79 (0.5 Z£), Small Magellanic Cloud massive star formation region NGC 346  (0.2 Z£),  NGC 6822 (0.3 Z£),  and I Zw18 (0.02 Z£).  Dust evolution in galaxies will target two galaxies, NGC 6822 and I Zw18, to study the infrared stellar populations including the dust producing asymptotic giant branch stars. Dust production may be dominated by supernova explosions. The best studied supernova, SN1987A, is observed to investigate the formation and evolution of dust in a supernova explosion.  This involves three of the JWST instruments and 5 instrument modes:  MIRI imaging, MIRI MRS spectroscopy, NIRCam imaging, NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy, NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy.</p><p></p><p>Work will include JWST data processing,  photometric and spectral analysis of the data.  Moreover, the postdoc will lead several papers on the results, and present the results at conferences.  Additional research and proposals</p><p></p><p><b>Qualifications:</b></p><p>Experience with image and spectroscopy data processing,  and photometric extraction.   Experience with JWST data especially desirable. Demonstrated ability to publish refereed journal articles.</p><p></p><p>Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoctoral Scholar positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique. This includes a variety of health, dental, vision, wellbeing, and retirement plans, paid time off, learning, rideshare, childcare, flexible schedule, parental leave and many more.
