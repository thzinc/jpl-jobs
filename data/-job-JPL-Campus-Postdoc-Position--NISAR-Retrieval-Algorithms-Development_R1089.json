    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and on Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and in communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to both contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The Postdoc at JPL benefits from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>The JPL Radar Science and Engineering Section is looking for a Postdoc to develop retrieval algorithms in preparation for the forthcoming NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission.</p><p></p><p>The NISAR mission is a dual-frequency L-/S-band SAR satellite scheduled for launch in late 2023 and recently identified as a pathfinder for the NASA Earth System Observatory. NISAR will acquire global dual-polarimetric L-band data with 20 MHz range bandwidth every 12 days (6 days ascending and descending), delivering unprecedented dense time-series of Geocoded Polarimetric Covariance Matrices (GCOV) and new Geocoded Single Look Complex (GSLC) products to address key science questions and application needs relevant to solid Earth, ecosystems, cryosphere, and hydrology. NASA is developing AWS cloud-based platforms to enable scientists and engineers to collaborate on new algorithms that can extract the desired information from NISAR products using the latest big-data and open-source technologies. </p><p></p><p>Retrieval algorithms will encompass the broad range of NISAR science and application requirements, including mapping of forest disturbances, above-ground biomass, inland water, surface deformation rate, ice sheet velocity, and soil moisture. Algorithms will be designed to work with the products generated by the NISAR processor and will ingest representative multi-frequency and multi-polarization radar data along with a variety of heterogeneous data products for calibration and validation.</p><p>The Postdoc will:</p><ul><li><p>Develop, implement, and test new and existing retrieval algorithms applicable to NISAR data in a cloud-based environment</p></li><li><p>Evaluate the benefits of AI and/or physics-based and statistical models for the retrieval algorithms and make extensive use of polarimetric covariance matrices and interferometric time-series.</p></li><li><p>Interact with the NISAR Algorithm Development Team and the NISAR Project Science Team as well as the broader science and application community</p></li><li><p>Disseminate the outcome of the algorithm development via github, conferences, and peer-reviewed publications</p></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p><b>Qualifications:</b></p><p></p><p>Applicants should have a PhD in:</p><ul><li><p>Physics or Environmental Science</p></li><li><p>Engineering or Computer Science</p></li><li><p>Earth system science or a related field. </p></li></ul><p></p><p>We seek a creative and highly motivated person with strong remote sensing background and software development skills, familiar with polarimetric SAR and interferometric SAR techniques and lidar algorithms, and excellent oral and written communication skills in English. The candidate must be detail oriented, be able to work both independently and in close collaboration with others, should have excellent abilities in programming (python or similar, and preferably C&#43;&#43;) and be familiar with spatial analysis methods as well as solutions for processing big data. Prior experience of working with InSAR techniques for vegetation remote sensing and surface deformation mapping, and with existing spaceborne and airborne SAR data are regarded as merits.</p><p></p><p>The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor.</p><p></p><p>Applicants may be subject to <a href=\"https://postdocs.jpl.nasa.gov/prospective-postdocs/eligibility/\" target=\"_blank\">additional program requirements</a> by NASA. Postdoc positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique. This includes a variety of health, dental, vision, wellbeing, and retirement plans, paid time off, learning, rideshare, childcare, flexible schedule, parental leave and many more.
