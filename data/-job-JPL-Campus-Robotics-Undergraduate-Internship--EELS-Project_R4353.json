We are located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we encourage passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward perfection.</p><p></p><p><b>Responsibilities: </b></p><p>The robotics section at JPL, the place where robots for planetary exploration are born! We engage in research, technology development, and the creation of sophisticated robotic hardware platforms and systems from architectural concept through operations.</p><p></p><p>Members of this team investigate, plan, build and develop robotic hardware for a wide variety of applications and environments. Robots developed by this team are built to operate from the ice expanses of the Arctic to the crushing depths of Earth’s oceans; from the hellish conditions of Venus, to Mars, to the frozen moons of Enceladus and Europa. Teams apply research to the planning, design, development, and testing of mechanical and/or electromechanical systems for mobility, manipulation, and climbing; sensors; instruments; and controls.</p><p></p><p><span>EELS is a snake-like robot designed to explore internal and enclosed dynamic terrain structures in order to assess habitability and evidence for life. It consists of multiple, identical, segments containing both the actuation and propulsion mechanisms as well as the power and communication electronics to drive them. EELS uses first-of-a-kind rotating propulsion units that act as tracks, gripping mechanisms and propeller units underwater, enabling the robot to access a plume vent exit and follow it to its ocean source.</span></p><p></p><p><span>As a software intern on the EELS project, you will work on a variety of tasks to help the team with developing and testing the EELS prototype robot. These tasks may include development of control software, development of testbed software (ground tools to support operation of the testbed), and development of simulation infrastructure. You will also be closely involved with hands-on testing and debug of the EELS prototype. </span></p><p></p><p><b>Qualifications: </b></p><p>What it takes:</p><ul><li>Must be available to work at least 40 hours/week, for at least 10 weeks in Summer 2023 (longer duration is welcome up to 16 weeks).</li><li>Must be currently enrolled in a college or university pursuing a bachelors, masters, or PhD in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Physics, Robotics, or related technical field.
