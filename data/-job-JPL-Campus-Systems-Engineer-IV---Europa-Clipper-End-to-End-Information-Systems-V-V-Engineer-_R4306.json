    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p><b>Responsibilities:</b></p><p></p><p>The<b> Project Systems Engineering &amp; Formulation Section</b> provides lifecycle leadership in the formulation, planning and execution of the project systems engineering function for JPL space flight missions from concept development through completion of post-Launch checkout and commissioning. Providing formulation services from concept ideation, to the full expression of that concept in formulation phase products, the creative and innovative personnel within this section are responsible for the leadership for project-wide systems engineering efforts, and the delivery of project-level systems engineering products. The section’s expertise spans a wide array of project products and disciplines, including: Project system and mission architectures, Risk Management, Project Software Systems Engineering, End-to-End Information Systems Engineering, Flight Project Cybersecurity, Project Protection Systems Engineering, among others.</p><p></p><p>Innovation drives so much of what we do at JPL, and our inclusiveness helps drive that innovation.</p><p></p><p><b>EEIS Engineering Tasks include the development of:</b></p><ul><li><p>An EEIS layered <i><b>architecture</b></i> which lays out flight assets, MOS teams, MOS processes, project data system(s) (flight and ground), and multi-mission services the project will use.</p></li><li><p>A set of <i><b>EEIS requirements</b></i> (usually in Level 2 or 2.5 of the project’s requirements hierarchy) on the EEIS design, that is consistent with and responsive to program, project and science requirements and constraints, and consistent with requirements on the mission design.</p></li><li><p>An <i><b>EEIS design</b></i> that is responsive to the EEIS requirements, allocates EEIS functions to project systems, and identifies EEIS interfaces between project systems. This design includes which data system standards are selected, and how and where they are implemented in the EEIS. The design is described in such a way that it provides a common understanding of the EEIS to the various implementation system managers and engineers.</p></li><li><p>A <i><b>Flight to Ground Interface Control Document (FGICD)</b></i> that specifies the interface between the spacecraft flight system and the Project&#39;s Ground Data System (GDS) and how they will interact. The FGICD is supplemented by detailed interface descriptions in the Command and Telemetry Dictionaries.  The FGICD includes:</p><ul><li><p>Specification of the formats and protocols that Flight and Ground will use to communicate with each other</p></li><li><p>Sub-allocations of functionality, performance, and operability between Flight and Ground  (When not specified in Project System (L2) requirements)</p></li><li><p>Requirements on one system that enable the other to perform its functions in accordance with the EEIS Concept or other Project-level design document.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A <i><b>set of requirements from the EEIS design</b></i> on the project systems (in Level 3 of the requirements hierarchy) that is responsive to the set of requirements on the EEIS design.</p></li><li><p>A <i><b>set of end-to-end information views</b></i> including organizational (objectives, roles, policies, activities, lifecycle, contracts), connectivity (physical, configuration, constraints, behaviors), communicational (protocol), functional (interactions, interfaces), and informational (structure, semantics, relationships, permanence, rules). These views describe the flow of data and control, across the end-to-end information system.</p></li><li><p>A plan for phased delivery and integration of ground and flight portions of the project EEIS is called the <i><b>EEIS Phased Development and Test Plan</b></i> (It is highly recommended that the project implementation plan follow this approach). In the Project definition phase, the EEIS engineer defines the EEIS project phases and identifies the tests associated with the successful completion of each phase. These tests occur before, during, and after ATLO (Assembly, Test, &amp; Launch Operations). It is the key to injecting operability features into the flight and ground design and testing them as they are developed and integrated into the MOS (Mission Operations System). A regression test is conducted at the start of each new EEIS phase to ensure that previous tested capabilities can be revalidated.</p></li><li><p>The <i><b>EEIS component of the Project V&amp;V plan</b></i> that describes demonstration, test, or analysis activities to be conducted by the project during ATLO to convince themselves that the project systems work together to meet the requirements on the EEIS.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>EEIS Engineering is, to a large extent, Operability Engineering:</b></p><ul><li><p>Reduce life cycle costs and mission risk by influencing the instrument, spacecraft, and MOS designs to make it easier to “operate the mission”.</p></li><li><p>Focus on enhancing the visibility and controllability of the flight/ground system</p></li><li><p>Provide improved EEIS performance and accountability by integrating leading CCSDS information system recommendations into the ground infrastructure services and program/project spacecraft capabilities</p></li><li><p>Provide the means to account for the production and delivery of observational products.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Key Tasks:</b></p><ul><li><p>Be the senior tester on the Clipper EEIS engineering team that works from the general EEIS test plan to develop the detailed test procedures for executing the Clipper EEIS test campaign in the following venues: System Test Bed, ATLO, and MIL-71.</p></li><li><p>Ensure from an End-to-End Information System point of view, that the Clipper level 2 EEIS requirements (on the order of 20) are verified/validated and evidence is documented/archived in data review packages.</p></li><li><p>Ensure that both the uplink and downlink requirements of the Clipper Flight to Ground ICD (FGICD) are verified/validated. They include CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) compatibility requirements between flight and ground systems.</p></li><li><p>Since cross-compatibility is a critical Clipper requirement, resolve in detail how cross-compatibility will be verified. This includes supporting test procedures and test execution: e.g., Deep Space Network (DSN) compatibility testing with the Clipper spacecraft including specification of the test configuration at MIL-71 (Cape Kennedy).</p></li><li><p>Document Clipper EEIS test results (data review packages) and provide lessons learned (presentations) back to the EEIS Group Supervisor.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>For these types of tasks, this position reports programmatically to the Clipper Lead EEIS Engineer (EEISE) and administratively to the Project Protection, Project Software and EEIS Engineering Group Supervisor in Section.</p><p></p><p><b>Qualifications:</b></p><ul><li><p>Bachelor’s degree in Aerospace Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, or related technical discipline with 9 years of related work experience; or Master’s degree in a similar discipline with 7 years of related work experience, or PhD. in a related technical discipline with 5 years of related work experience.</p></li><li><p>Prior experience with Testbed and/or ATLO test venues doing requirement verification/closure of Level 5/6</p></li><li><p>Prior experience with retrieving and analyzing data from FIT or GDS test tools (e.g., Test Rail, etc.), scripting languages (e.g., python), and testbed tools (e.g., Ingenium – facilitating test procedure automation), writing testbed and ATLO procedures.</p></li><li><p>Strong practical background in either flight or ground system engineering (preferably at levels 2, 3, or 4) or software system engineering, or system and software verification and validation, or data modeling techniques and software testing tools.</p></li><li><p>Successful track record of creative problem solving and innovation.</p></li><li><p>Experience in leveraging data analysis tools and techniques for analyzing end-to-end data flow and test results.</p></li><li><p>Ability to work independently but with direction from both the line and project organization.</p></li><li><p>Must be a go-getter and self-starter with ability to work across multiple cross-discipline teams with typically limited direction.</p></li><li><p>Frequently capable of working outside of one’s organization with external partners on technical issues.</p></li><li><p>Must have excellent verbal, written, and presentation skills; will present work during management (e.g., PMRs) and project reviews (or provide technical materials for such reviews)</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Preferred Skills</b>:</p><ul><li><p>Experience in the design, development, and operations of flight or ground systems</p></li><li><p>Knowledgeable of on-board and ground information and software systems and their interfaces.</p></li><li><p>Knowledgeable of JPL multi-mission systems, services and CCSDS Information System Standards such as CFDP.</p></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique.
