    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>The Radar Science and Engineering Section at JPL is looking for a postdoc to explore innovative remote sensing techniques for millimeter wave spaceborne weather radar.  This effort builds on the RainCube (Radar in a CubeSat) Ka-band weather radar and aims at paving the way for the next generation of radar observations of cloud and precipitation from space.</p><p></p><p>The postdoc will:</p><p>• Simulate notional spaceborne radar echoes from cloud, precipitation and the surface based on numerical weather models.</p><p>• Develop theory for using multi-antenna or multi-radar observations to estimate of vertical profiles of reflectivity and Doppler velocity.</p><p>• Process and analyze spaceborne and airborne weather radar data to identify and reproduce observations with high-fidelity signal simulations.</p><p>• Support trade studies to quantify the performance of different notional radar configurations and signal processing algorithm.</p><p>• Publish the outcome of the investigation in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals.</p><p></p><p><b>Qualifications:</b></p><p>Applicants should have a Ph.D. in:</p><ul><li>Electrical engineering, physics or a related field.</li></ul><p></p><p>Direct experience in radar remote sensing, atmospheric physics, electromagnetic theory, information theory and mathematics are highly desired.</p><p></p><ul><li>The candidate should have a proven track record of publication in peer-review journals with excellent oral and written communication skills.</li><li>The candidate must be detail oriented, be able to work both independently and in close collaboration with others.</li><li>The candidate should have excellent abilities in programming (e.g., MATLAB, Python or C/C&#43;&#43;).</li></ul><p></p><p>We seek a creative and highly motivated person with a strong background in radar signal simulations and weather radar algorithm development.
