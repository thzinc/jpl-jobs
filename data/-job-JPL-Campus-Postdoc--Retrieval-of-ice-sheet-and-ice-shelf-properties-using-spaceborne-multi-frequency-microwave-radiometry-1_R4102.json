    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and on Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and in communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to both contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The Postdoctoral scholars at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p><b>Responsibilities:</b></p><p>The candidate will be a member of the microwave instrument science group (386G).  Our group specializes in passive microwave remote sensing at Earth and across our solar system. We perform microwave remote sensing instrument concept development, performance specification, calibration, and scientific utilization for spaceborne, airborne, and ground-based systems.  Our group is responsible for developing state-of-the-art passive microwave instruments that respond to NASA/NOAA/DoD/NSF needs, developing performance requirements for microwave instruments, calibrating passive microwave instruments pre- and post-launch, developing retrieval algorithms to extract geophysical information from microwave radiometer data and scientific utilization of JPL and other microwave instruments resulting in presentations at conferences and publications in the literature.</p><p></p><p>The candidate will retrieve geophysical parameters for polar research using currently operating satellites. The focus will be on the development of next-generation retrieval algorithms for ice sheets and ice shelves using measurements from radiometers operating in the 1.4-36.5 GHz frequency range (mostly SMAP, SMOS, AMSR-E, and AMSR2). The goal is to retrieve vertical profiles of meltwater, density, and temperature of ice sheets and ice shelves, exploiting the variable sensing depth and sensitivity of the multi-frequency observations. The tasks include processing and calibrating spaceborne microwave radiometer data, developing and validating retrieval algorithms, and analyzing the retrieved parameters. The work will be conducted in a collaborative team environment to achieve the objectives. The candidate will publish the results in peer-reviewed literature.</p><p></p><p><b>Qualifications:</b></p><p>Candidates should have a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, Geosciences, Environmental Sciences, or a related field with a strong background in remote sensing. Previous experience in processing and analyzing spaceborne microwave radiometer data is expected. The selected candidate will work as a member of a team, but the ability to work independently is essential and strong motivation for publishing is required.</p><p></p><p>Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoctoral Scholar positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique. This includes a variety of health, dental, vision, wellbeing, and retirement plans, paid time off, learning, rideshare, childcare, flexible schedule, parental leave and many more. Our focus is on work-life balance, and living healthy, fulfilling lives as we Dare Mighty Things Together.
