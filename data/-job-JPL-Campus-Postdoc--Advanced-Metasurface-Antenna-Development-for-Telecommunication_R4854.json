    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>Join the forefront of cutting-edge research at the renowned JPL as we push the boundaries of telecommunication technology. Our team has pioneered metal-only metasurface antennas for Ka-band applications [1], and we are now seeking a highly motivated and skilled candidate for a postdoctoral position to design dual-frequency antennas.</p><p>Project Overview: The primary focus of this project is to harness the transformative capabilities of modulated metasurfaces (MTSs) in crafting ultra-thin, dual-band, and directive antennas. Our goal is to advance the development of dual-frequency right-handed circularly polarized antennas, specifically targeting X-band (7.145–7.190 GHz uplink, 8.40-8.45 GHz downlink) and Ka-band (34.2–34.7 GHz uplink, 31.8–32.3 GHz downlink) using state-of-the-art additive manufacturing techniques.</p><p></p><p><b>Responsibilities:</b></p><p>As a key member of our team, the successful candidate will be tasked with:</p><p>Algorithm and Software Development: Designing cutting-edge algorithms and software tools essential for the conceptualization and optimization of these advanced antennas. Fabrication and Testing: Overseeing the entire process from fabrication to testing, ensuring the antennas meet the project&#39;s stringent specifications.</p><p></p><p>Required Expertise: We are seeking candidates with a robust background in:</p><p>•             Computational Electromagnetics</p><p>•             Antenna Theory</p><p>•             Microwave Engineering</p><p>•             Antenna Arrays</p><p>•             Periodic Structures</p><p>•             Radiation</p><p>Collaboration: The selected candidate will collaborate closely with mechanical engineers, structural engineers, and systems engineers to ensure the full qualification of the antenna, achieving a Technology Readiness Level 5 (TRL-5).</p><p></p><p><b>Qualifications:</b></p><p>•             A Ph.D. in a relevant field</p><p>•             Proven experience in computational electromagnetic and antenna design</p><p>•             Strong familiarity with additive manufacturing techniques</p><p></p><p>What We Offer:</p><p>•             Opportunity to work on groundbreaking projects at the forefront of space and telecommunication technology</p><p>•             Collaborative environment with experts in various disciplines</p><p></p><p>If you are passionate about advancing antenna technology and contributing to the future of space exploration, we invite you to apply for this exciting postdoctoral position.</p><p>[1] D.
