    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>JPL invites applications for a for a postdoc research position in the study of exoplanet atmospheres using remote observations. The successful candidate will build a pipeline to extract and analyze spectroscopic data of transiting giant exoplanets with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The appointee will carry out research with the JPL advisor and other collaborators at JPL, Caltech, and around the world, and will be encouraged to present the results of the research at conferences and in peer reviewed journal articles.</p><p></p><p>The postdoc will benefit from the interactive and interdisciplinary environment enabled by JPL, with connections between astrophysics, planetary science, and earth science in study of exoplanets. JPL furthers science, technology, and program implementation in the discovery, characterization, and comparison of exoplanets, towards ultimately addressing the question of habitability in the universe.</p><p></p><p>Required Qualifications:</p><p></p><p>-  PhD in astronomy, planetary science, astrobiology, or relevant fields</p><p></p><p>-  Strong programming skills in Python, Fortran, or related programming languages</p><p></p><p>-  Demonstrated ability to write and publish scientific results</p><p></p><p>-  Ability to work effectively in a team environment</p><p></p><p>Preferred Qualifications:</p><p></p><p>-  Knowledge of JWST data and its observing modes</p><p></p><p>-  Experience with analysis of observations of transiting exoplanets and their atmospheres</p><p></p><p>-  Experience with 1D/2D/3D atmospheric modeling is a plus</p><p></p><p>Scientists who underrepresented groups in STEM fields are strongly encouraged to apply.</p><p></p><p>Please submit a CV including a publication list, a cover letter that includes a brief description of current and future research interests as well as a description of how you would support diversity and inclusion at JPL, and names and contact information of three references. The due date for applications is February 12, 2023. Applications should be sent as a single PDF to this site.</p><p></p><p>Applicants may be subject to <a href=\"http://postdocs.jpl.nasa.gov/prospective-postdocs/eligibility/\" target=\"_blank\">additional program requirements</a> by NASA.
