    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>Understanding the dust and water cycles on Mars, and their interactions, is crucial for understanding the martian atmosphere. Dust and water ice clouds can have a strong radiative impact on the atmosphere, influencing its thermal structure and circulation. There is also a complex feedback between the dust and water cycles. The dust distribution influences where and when clouds form, as the dust particles act as condensation nuclei. As such, the number and size of dust particles affects the number and size of ice particles, and hence the radiative impact of the clouds. Additionally, clouds can impact the dust distribution, as cloud formation limits the vertical extent of dust, and the sedimentation of ice particles can transport dust to lower altitudes.</p><p></p><p>Recent analyses of Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) data [e.g., Kleinböhl et al. 2009] have revealed large amplitude thermal tides in the atmosphere that were previously unknown [Steele et al. 2021a]. These are most prominent in the tropics, appear after dust storms in all the Mars Years observed by MCS, and show large changes over relatively short time scales of 1-2 hours [Steele et al. 2021b]. The data suggest that both dust and ice are influencing the structure of the atmosphere, but it is not possible to determine the impact of each from the data alone, or how the dust and ice are interacting with each other. Additionally, these newly described large amplitude tides are not captured in Global Climate Models (GCMs). As such, a fundamental component of the atmospheric dynamics is missing.</p><p></p><p>This project aims to study how the dust and water cycle interaction affects the atmospheric temperature structure, circulation, and the transport of trace constituents throughout dust storms on present-day Mars. In particular, the research should lead to the identification of transport pathways for dust and water during large-scale regional dust storms and how these differ depending on the dust particle size distribution. Additionally, the interaction between the dust and water cycles during dust storms should be quantified in terms of microphysical processes and the radiative impacts of dust and water ice. The successful candidate will perform numerical simulations of increasing complexity using a GCM in order to study these processes. Comparisons of the modeled dust, ice and temperature distributions with MCS observations of these fields will reveal sources of error in the GCM, mechanisms responsible for the observed strong tidal features, and potential avenues for model improvement.</p><p></p><p>References:</p><p>- Kleinböhl, A., et al., Mars Climate Sounder Limb Profile Retrieval of atmospheric Temperature, Pressure, Dust and Water ice opacity, J.
