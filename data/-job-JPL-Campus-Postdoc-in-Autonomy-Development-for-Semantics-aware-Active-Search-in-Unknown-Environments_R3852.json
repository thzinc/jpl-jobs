    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges.</p><p></p><p>The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>JPL invites applications for a postdoc position in JPL&#39;s Mobility and Robotic Systems Section. The broad topic is robotic autonomy (including mobility, perception, single- and multi-agent autonomy, and communication). The focus is on semantics-aware active search in unknown environment. This position will support basic and applied research projects funded by a variety of sources. Details can be tailored to some degree to the experience and interest of selected applicants. Some of the projects include: </p><ul><li>Ground autonomy for exploring caves and subterranean environments in planetary bodies</li><li>Innovative technologies for semantics-aware autonomous source seeking</li><li>Communication-aware autonomy for a coordinated team of small ground robots</li></ul><p></p><p>The projects are joint between JPL and a few partnering schools (Stanford and Caltech). The position is available immediately. </p><p></p><p>Candidates can apply to one (or more) of the following areas (it is a strong plus if you are an expert in more than one area): </p><ul><li>Algorithms/Machine Learning (requires strong background in robotic perception, localization, 3D mapping, planning, or multi-agent communication) </li><li>Software (requires strong software development skills, feeling at home working with C&#43;&#43;, Python, and ROS) </li><li>System (requires background in system engineering, integration, and embedded computing) </li></ul><p></p><p>The JPL postdoc advisor to the selected candidate works in JPL&#39;s Mobility and Robotic Systems Section. The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publications in the open literature. </p><p></p><p><b>Required Qualifications:</b></p><ul><li>Candidates should have a PhD in Computer Science, Robotics, or related field. </li><li>Strong background in at least one of the above-mentioned areas (Algorithms/ML, Software, System) is required. </li><li>Past experience in field robotics is a plus. </li></ul><p></p><p>Please submit a CV including a publication list, a cover letter that includes a brief description of current and future research interests and names and contact information of three references. The due date for applications is February 16, 2023. Applications should be sent as a single PDF to this site. </p><p></p><p>Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoc positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. </p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique.
