    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>As a Guidance and Control engineer at JPL, you will be working for JPL’s Guidance and Control Section (343) where you have the opportunity to design and operate the world’s most advanced spacecraft, aircraft, and robots for deep-space and planetary exploration. The Section 343 is responsible for system engineering, design and analysis, hardware development/procurement, testing, and operations support in G&amp;C areas for unique planetary, deep-space, earth-orbiting, and astrophysics missions. We also do world class research and technology development in autonomous guidance, navigation and control systems including pin-point and safe landing, space rendezvous, precision pointing, controlled optics, vision-based navigation, planetary aerial flight/rotorcraft, formation flying, and other key areas that enable future planetary exploration.</p><p></p><p>As part of the <b>Entry, Descent, and Landing Guidance and Control Systems Group (3436) </b>you would be responsible for modeling and analyzing spacecraft flight mechanics performance as it is affected by guidance, navigation and control (GN&amp;C) embedded software in relevant environments.  Performance analysis includes vehicle targeting for in-situ landing, embedded software parameter determination, spacecraft and algorithm performance margin assessment, outlier behavior investigations, and vehicle and sub-system performance reliability analysis.  We also receive and develop various models of spacecraft environments and hardware, including planetary gravity models, atmospheric models, spacecraft sensors, actuators, and mechanisms.  The group also regularly executes sensitivity studies, uncertainty quantification analysis, and parameter optimization analyses.  We are responsible for the associated data mining, metrics development, and reporting to customers in all phases of development (formulation through operations).</p><p></p><p>Other responsibilities include:</p><p>·       Aiding fellow Guidance and Control Section (343) members in conceiving, designing, analyzing, simulating, overseeing, and assessing complex performance at the G&amp;C subsystem level and flight vehicle level.</p><p>·       Integrating deliveries of G&amp;C subsystem software and detailed sensor, actuator, and other flight hardware models for vehicle simulation and performance analysis.  Deliveries will vary in fidelity depending on heritage and analysis fidelity requirements in different as a project/task matures.</p><p>·       Developing tools and techniques to extract and present detailed performance metrics and reports from very large data sets (a.k.a. “data mining”) for the G&amp;C, team and flight vehicle customers for EDL, Deorbit Descent and Landing (DDL), Aerocapture, Aerobraking, and small body proximity operations including Touch-and-Go (TaG) sampling.</p><p>·       Leading teams that assess flight mechanics and perform independent verification and validation of GN&amp;C performance at the subsystem and vehicle system level, as well as coordinating their efforts to document the performance of these systems during all phases of a flight mission.</p><p></p><p><b>Qualifications</b></p><p></p><p>This position requires one of the following:</p><ul><li>Bachelor’s degree in
