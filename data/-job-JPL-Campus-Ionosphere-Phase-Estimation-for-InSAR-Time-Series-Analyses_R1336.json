    "jobDescription": "<h1><b>Job Details</b></h1><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL&#39;s science and engineering organizations and Caltech&#39;s academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines&#39; languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity&#39;s core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions&#39; results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration&#39;s challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.</p><p></p><p>The Radar Science and Engineering section at JPL is looking for a postdoc to develop, implement, and test new algorithms to be adopted by the Observational Products for End-users using Remote sensing Analysis (OPERA) project to generate surface displacement products over North America.</p><p>The postdoc will help develop new ionosphere phase estimation and phase unwrapping algorithms to correct and improve the accuracy of remote sensing products derived from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis. The suitable candidate will also contribute to the verification of the displacement time-series algorithm over representative regions in North America covered by the OPERA displacement product.</p><p></p><p>The postdoc will contribute to:</p><p>• Develop and implement a new algorithm for correcting the ionosphere phase screen affecting InSAR time-series data using Total Electron Content maps derived from dual-frequency GNSS data.</p><p>• Test and quantify the accuracy of the newly developed algorithm on time series of C-band (e.g., Sentinel-1A/B) and L-band (e.g., NISAR) InSAR data and compare its performance with that from state-of-the-art methods (e.g., split-spectrum).</p><p>• Improve state-of-the-art phase unwrapping algorithms to reduce unwrapping errors and computational runtime for fine resolution wrapped interferograms.</p><p>• Verify the selected OPERA’s surface displacement algorithm over North America with a focus on regions affected by significant temporal decorrelation changes (e.g., areas with snowfall).</p><p>• Publish outcomes in high-impact peer-reviewed journals.</p><p></p><p>The outcome of this investigation will inform the OPERA project algorithm development team on the ionosphere phase correction algorithm to adopt for generating OPERA displacement products.</p><p></p><p><b>Qualifications:</b></p><p>Applicants may have a PhD in:</p><p>• Electrical or telecommunication engineering</p><p>• Geomatics or environmental engineering</p><p>• Geophysics or related field</p><p></p><p>We seek a creative and highly motivated candidate with a strong background in SAR interferometry and SAR algorithm development, particularly in the field of repeat-pass and time-series interferometry. The candidate should have excellent oral and written communication skills.</p><p></p><p>The candidate must be detail-oriented and capable of working both independently and in close collaboration with others, and should have excellent abilities in programming with Python and preferably also C&#43;&#43;.</p><p></p><p>Prior experience working with InSAR time series analysis, repeat-pass interferometry, and publication record in these fields are regarded as merits.</p><p></p><p>The appointee will be advised, and will collaborate with OPERA’s algorithm development team and OPERA’s project science team.</p><p></p><p>Applicants may be subject to <a href=\"https://postdocs.jpl.nasa.gov/prospective-postdocs/eligibility/\" target=\"_blank\">additional program requirements</a> by NASA. Postdoc positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit the following to this site: CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">JPL has a catalog of benefits and perks that span from the traditional to the unique. This includes a variety of health, dental, vision, wellbeing, and retirement plans, paid time off, learning, rideshare, childcare, flexible schedule, parental leave and many more.
