That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.</p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p style=\"text-align:inherit\"></p><p>The robotics section at JPL is the place where robots for planetary exploration are born! We engage in research, technology development, and the creation of sophisticated robotic autonomy capabilities through development, testing and integration on robotic hardware from architectural concept through operations.</p><p></p><p>Members of this team investigate, plan, build and develop robotic hardware and software for a wide variety of applications and environments. Robots developed by this team are built to operate from the ice expanses of the Arctic to the crushing depths of Earth’s oceans; from the hellish conditions of Venus, to Mars, to the frozen moons of Enceladus and Europa. Teams apply research to the analysis, planning, design, development, and testing of mechanical, electrical and software systems for mobility, manipulation, and climbing; sensors; instruments; and controls.</p><p></p><p>The Ingenuity Mars Helicopter project is focused on the continued operation of Ingenuity in support of the Perseverance rover. Additionally, all of the data collected from Ingenuity is invaluable in understanding the performance of helicopters on Mars to inform the future design of Martian aerial vehicles.</p><p></p><p>As an intern on the Ingenuity team, you will be responsible for managing the organization, archiving and analysis of the whole history of Ingenuity’s flight data. Organzing the data will have you dive deep into understanding the helicopter system, its history of flights and the available information. In the archiving work you will work closely with NASA Armstrong, who manage a long-term public archive. You will develop Python scripts to efficiently convert data from the current stored format into an accessible format that others, external to NASA, can access. Through working with Ingenuity’s data you will gain insight into the performance, including the opportunity to contribute to long-term trending analysis of performance. Throughout you will work closely with the Ingenuity Operations team.</p><p></p><p><b>Qualifications: </b></p><p>What it takes:</p><ul><li>Must be available to work between 8-19 hours/week while enrolled in school.</li><li>Must be currently enrolled in a college or university pursuing a bachelors, masters, or PhD in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Physics, Robotics, or related technical field.
